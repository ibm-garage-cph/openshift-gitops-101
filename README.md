## 1. Install operator

1. Create a project named `argocd`

2. With the `argocd` project selected, go to the operator hub and search for `argo`

3. Select the Argo CD operator

![step1](/images/step1.1.png)

*Note: use the ArgoCD provided operator*

4. Select `Continue` and `Install`

5. On the `Create Operator Subscription` screen, select the installation namespace to be `argocd` (your newly created project)

![step1](/images/step1.2.png)

## 2. Check installation

1. Normally it takes a minute or two until the installation is complete. A good indication is when the pods in the `argocd` namespace are stable (1/1)

2. To enable full cluster admin access on OpenShift, run the following command. This step is generally optional but recommended for this exercise.

    ```bash
    oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin -z argocd-application-controller -n argocd
    ```

## 3. Enable the ArgoCD UI

1. Take the yaml located [here](./1_argo-cd.yaml) and apply it inside the `argocd` namespace

    ```bash
    # selecting project
    oc project argocd

    # applying ArgoCD resource
    oc apply -f ./0_argo-cd.yaml
    ```

2. There will be several Argo CD resources created that should be familiar to anyone who has deployed Argo CD.

    ```bash
    oc get cm,secret,deploy
    ```

3. When everything is installed, you can fetch argocd's URLs:

    ```bash
    oc get routes
    ``` 

4. Open the route URL in a browser

5. One of the cluster `Secrets` contains the admin password for authenticating with Argo CD, as well as the Grafana dashboard, if enabled. Fetch the admin password from the cluster Secret.

    ```bash
    kubectl get secret example-argocd-cluster -o jsonpath='{.data.admin\.password}' | base64 -d
    ```

6. You can log into the web UI with the username `admin` and the password extracted from the step above

![step1](/images/step2.png)

7. You should have access to the main dashboard

## 4. Create you application

1. Click on `NEW APP`.
2. Add the below details:
   - Application Name: `sample`
   - Project: `default`
   - SYNC POLICY: `Manual`
   - REPO URL: `https://github.com/ibm-garage-cph/openshift-gitops-101`
   - Revision: `HEAD`
   - Path: `openshift`

![app details one](/images/app_argo_1.png)

3. Cluster: Select the default one `https://kubernetes.default.svc` to deploy in-cluster
4. Namespace: `dev-<your initials>` (e.g. dev-mn)
5. Click Create to finish

![app details two](/images/app_argo_2.png)

6. You will now see the available apps.

![sampleapp create](/images/sampleapp_create.png)

![sampleapp create](./images/sampleapp_create.png)

7. Initially, the app will be out of sync. It is yet to be deployed. You need to sync it for deploying. To sync the application, click `SYNC` and then `SYNCHRONIZE`.

![out of sync](./images/out_of_sync.png)

8. Wait untill the app is deployed.

![synched app](./images/synched_app.png)

9. Once the app is deployed, click on it to see the details.

## 5. Verifying the deployment

- Access the app to verify if it is correctly deployed.
- List the cloudnativesampleapp-service route
- 
    ```bash
    oc get route
    ```
    It should have an IP under `EXTERNAL-IP` column
    ```
    NAME                 HOST/PORT                                     PATH   SERVICES                       PORT   TERMINATION   WILDCARD
    cloudnative-sample   cloudnative-sample-default.apps-crc.testing          cloudnativesampleapp-service   9080                 None
    ```
- Set an environment variable `APP_URL` using the `EXTERNAL-IP`

    ```bash
    export APP_URL="http://$(oc get route cloudnative-sample -o jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}')"
    echo ARGOCD_SERVER=$APP_URL
    ```

- Access the url using `curl`
  
    ```bash
    curl "$APP_URL/greeting?name=Carlos"
    ```

    ```json
    {"id":2,"content":"Welcome to Cloudnative bootcamp !!! Hello, Carlos :)"}
    ```


## 6. Using the ArgoCD CLI

- Login using the cli.
- Login as the `admin` user.
- The initial password is autogenerated. It's the same password as in step 3.5
- Now login as follows.
    ```bash
    argocd login $ARGOCD_SERVER
    ```
    
    ```
